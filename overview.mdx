## Downloading Snapshots & Setting Up Master Sub Accounts

Creating a Master Sub account for a snapshot that you import is an important step in making it easier to update your client sub accounts. 

\_\*\*\* A snapshot is essentially a backup of a sub account. Our snapshots are backups of the sub accounts we've created in our High Level. This allows us to share those backups with you. \_

The reason you want to create a master snapshot is because you can easily push out updates from internal sub accounts that you create instead trying to update from an imported snapshot...which can be very time consuming. 

This may not make a whole lot of sense right now, but I walk you through it in the video below and I think it will answer any questions.
